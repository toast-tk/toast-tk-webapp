# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# ~~~~~

http.cacheControl=0
http.exposePlayServer=false

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!
application.secret="ZpV]_Wb]nhD/W5c^4XD?0d2i_;6qn:_mdWc@vL=wqwpr[J:RIr<G5LFaLt9lJ:id"

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="en"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
application.global= boot.AppBoot

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes


# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
# Example
# With a local mongo instance hosting a play_db and listening on port 27017
#mongo.db.url="mongodb://localhost:27017/play_db"
mongo.db.url=${MONGOHQ_URL}

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

logger.reactivemongo=DEBUG
